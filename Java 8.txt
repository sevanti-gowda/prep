Functional interface---------
An interface that contains exactly one interface and can have any number of static, default methods.

package com.testa;
 
@FunctionalInterface
public interface CiGusta {
	
	void order(String topping, Boolean extraCheese);
 
}

public class TestMain {	
 
	public static void main(String[] args) {	
		
		TestMain tm = new TestMain();
		tm.orderItems();
	}	
	
	//waiter takes the order
	public void orderItems() {
		// pasta
		orderPizza( (x,y)->System.out.println("toppings are : "+ x +"  is extra cheese needed? : " + y) );
	}
	
	//internal processing
	public void orderPizza( CiGusta cg ) {
		cg.order(" jalapeno & bellpepper & paneer ", true);
	} 	
	
		
}

//(x,y)->System.out.println("toppings are : "+ x +"  is extra cheese needed? : " + y) is the lambda function
//where the text before -> which is (x,y) are the params of the method
// the text after -> is the method body

Lamda function: it is an anonymous function which can send method as an input parameter to other methods.
Relation btw functional interface and lamda function:lamda function can be sent as an input parameter to other methods which takes functional interface as input parameters.
The method body of the lamda function will become the body of abstract function in the functional interface.

Uses of static and default methods in FI:
Static methods in FI are utility methods which are used to have some utility functionality like printing a bill.

When there are multiple classes implementing a FI,
If we want a particular implementation only in few classes out of all those implementing classes (Seasonal collection only in a few locations of ZARA)
then default methods will be helpful inachieving this.
Default methods can be overridden but they need not be overridden.

@FunctionalInterface
public interface Zara {
	
	void usualCollection();
	
	default void seasonalCollection() {
		//design
	}
	
	static String printBill() {
		return " Bill ";
	}
 
}
 
 
public class ZaraMadhapur  implements Zara {
 
	//Mall
	@Override
	public void usualCollection() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		
	}
	
	
 
}

public class ZaraHitechCity implements Zara{
 
	//Big Zara Outlet
	@Override
	public void usualCollection() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		
	}
 
}
