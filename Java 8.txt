//(x,y)->System.out.println("toppings are : "+ x +"  is extra cheese needed? : " + y) is the lambda function
//where the text before -> which is (x,y) are the params of the method
// the text after -> is the method body

Lamda function: it is an anonymous function which can send method as an input parameter to other methods.
it can be sent as an input parameter to other methods which takes functional interface as input parameters.
The method body of the lamda function will become the body of abstract function in the functional interface.
